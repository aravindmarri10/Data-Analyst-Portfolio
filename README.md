# 🧠 Capstone Project: Python Logic & OOP Solutions

Welcome! This is my first portfolio project as part of my journey to become a Data Analyst.  
I have included 5 hand-coded Python problems using key concepts like:

- 🔁 Loops and conditionals  
- 🧮 Functional tools (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming  
- 🔎 List and dictionary manipulation
  

## 📌 Problem List 

1. **Vowel vs Consonant Name Split**  
   ➤ Separate a list of names into vowels and consonants

2. **Fibonacci Generator**  
   ➤ Generate the Fibonacci sequence using a `while` loop

3. **Digit Frequency Counter**  
   ➤ Count how many times a digit appears between 1 and N

4. **Even/Odd Transformer**  
   ➤ Use `map`, `filter`, `reduce` to process even/odd numbers

5. **Basketball Game Class**  
   ➤ Create a class with scoring methods and print total score

## 🧠 Why This Project?

This project helped me apply all the Python concepts I learned and boosted my confidence in solving real-world logic-based problems.  
It’s the first entry in my data-focused GitHub portfolio.
